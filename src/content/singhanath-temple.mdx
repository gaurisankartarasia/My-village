# Singhanath Temple, Badamba, Odisha

## Introduction

The Singhanath Temple, also referred to as Simhanath Temple, is an ancient Hindu shrine located on a small island in the Mahanadi River near Badamba, in the Cuttack district of Odisha, India. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped as Singhanath, the temple is renowned for its architectural splendor, historical significance, and unique location. Dating back to the early 9th century AD, it stands as a testament to the rich cultural and religious heritage of Odisha, blending Saivaite and Vaishnava traditions in its sculptural embellishments.

Situated in Gopinathpur village, Baramba tehsil, the temple is accessible via the iconic T-shaped bridge, one of Odisha’s longest river bridges, connecting it to the mainland from both Badamba and Banki sides. The serene setting, surrounded by the flowing waters of the Mahanadi River, enhances its spiritual aura, making it a popular destination for pilgrims seeking divine blessings and tourists exploring Odisha’s historical and natural beauty.

## History and Legend

The Singhanath Temple holds a significant place in Hindu mythology and history. According to local legends, the temple is associated with Lord Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu, who worshipped Lord Shiva here. The name "Singhanath" derives from "Singha" (lion) and "Nath" (lord), reflecting the lion-headed form of Narasimha. Some traditions suggest that Lord Laxman, brother of Lord Rama, established this shrine, adding to its mythological importance.

Historically, the temple is believed to have been constructed during the Somavanshi dynasty, around the early 9th century AD, as evidenced by its architectural style and sculptural details. It represents an early example of the Pancharatha Deula of Kalinga architecture, showcasing the artistic and religious syncretism of the period. The temple’s location on an island in the Mahanadi River adds to its mystical allure, making it a unique pilgrimage site revered across Odisha.

## Architecture and Surroundings

The Singhanath Temple is a prime example of the Panchayatana style of architecture, a practice attributed to Adi Shankara, where the main shrine is surrounded by four subsidiary shrines dedicated to other deities—Vishnu, Ganesh, Surya, and Mahishamardini. The main temple features a rekha deula (curvilinear tower) and a jagamohana (assembly hall) with a terraced roof, both characteristic of traditional Kalinga architecture. The sanctum sanctorum houses a Shivalinga with a yonipatta attached to the earth, a distinctive feature of this temple.

The temple complex is adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, blending Saivaite and Vaishnava iconography, which makes it unique among Odisha’s temples. These carvings reflect the rich cultural and artistic heritage of the region, offering insights into ancient traditions and beliefs.

The temple’s island location in the Mahanadi River creates a serene and picturesque environment. The T-shaped bridge, a marvel of engineering, connects the temple to the mainland, making it accessible except during the monsoon season when high river levels may restrict access. Visitors often describe the tranquil setting and the cooling effect of the river as enhancing the spiritual experience.
