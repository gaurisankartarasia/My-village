### **The Enduring Legacy of Badamba: A Comprehensive History of the Town and Former Princely State in Odisha, India**

#### **I. Introduction**

Badamba, a historic town now recognized as a Notified Area Council (NAC) in the Cuttack district of Odisha, India, holds a distinguished place in the region's historical tapestry. Located at PIN 754031, Badamba is geographically characterized by its picturesque setting on the southern banks of the Mahanadi River, nestled amidst the foothills of the Eastern Ghats and surrounding mountain ranges, including the Ratnagiri mountains. ¹, blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com Its recent administrative upgrade to a NAC on February 24, 2024, by the Government of Odisha underscores its contemporary growth and evolving urban identity.¹ The town is an integral part of the Baramba constituency, which also encompasses the Baramba block and Narasinghpur block.¹ Renowned for its rich cultural heritage and historical significance, Badamba was once the capital of Baramba State, a prominent princely state under the British Raj, part of the Eastern States Agency.³ The town is home to the Bhattarika Temple, a significant Shakti Pitha, which attracts devotees and tourists alike. (History of Badamba Town, Odisha, India)

The historical trajectory of Badamba is profoundly shaped by its past as Baramba State. The town's origins are traditionally dated to 1305 CE, with the establishment of the Baramba dynasty by King Hatakeshwar Raut, a Chandra Banshi Kshatriya wrestler from Singhbhum.¹, (Baramba State) Badamba's narrative is a rich blend of ancient mythological connections, centuries of princely rule, and its eventual integration into modern India, reflecting a complex interplay of political, cultural, and socio-economic transformations. This report delves into these layers of history, offering a comprehensive account of Badamba's enduring legacy.

#### **II. Geography and Ancient Roots (Pre-1305 CE)**

**Geography**

Badamba is located between 20° 21' and 20° 31' N latitude and 84° 32' and 85° 31' E longitude, covering an area of approximately 134 square miles. The town is bounded by Hindol State to the north, Tigiria State to the east, Cuttack district and Khandpara State to the south (with the Mahanadi River forming the boundary), and Narsinghpur State to the west. The region features flat, fertile terrain prone to flooding from the Mahanadi River. The Kanaka peak, rising to 2,038 feet, is a prominent geographical feature on the northern border, contributing to the town’s scenic landscape. (History of Badamba Town, Odisha, India)

**Badamba within the Broader Historical Landscape of Kalinga and Odisha**

To fully appreciate Badamba's historical depth, it is essential to situate it within the broader historical currents of Odisha, a region known by various ancient names such as Utkala, Kalinga, and Odra Desha.⁶ This land was home to formidable political powers that shaped its identity long before the formal establishment of Baramba State. Early significant dynasties, including the Nandas, the Mauryans (with Ashoka's pivotal conquest of Kalinga in 260 BCE), and the Kalinga emperor Kharavela in the 1st century BCE, laid down foundational political and cultural structures.⁶ The region's strategic coastal position fostered its emergence as a significant maritime power from the 1st century CE onwards, influencing trade and cultural exchange across Southeast Asia.⁶ Subsequent centuries saw the rise of powerful dynasties such as the Bhauma-Karas (8th-10th centuries), the Soma kings (until 11th century), and later the influential Ganga and Surya dynasties.⁶ These regional developments established a rich historical context that, while not directly mentioning Badamba, created the socio-political and cultural environment in which the town would eventually emerge. This underscores that Badamba's later status as a princely state was not an isolated event but a development within a landscape profoundly shaped by millennia of powerful kingdoms, extensive maritime trade, and continuous cultural evolution.

**Evidence of Prehistoric Settlements in the Mahanadi Basin**

While specific archaeological findings for Badamba town itself are not extensively detailed for the prehistoric period ¹, evidence from the wider Mahanadi basin suggests a long history of human habitation in the region. Archaeological studies in the Jonk river basin, a major tributary of the upper Mahanadi, have unearthed numerous prehistoric sites.¹⁰ These include Acheulian, Middle Palaeolithic, Microlithic, Neolithic, and Early Historic sites, indicating continuous human presence over vast stretches of time.¹⁰ These ancient settlements were often located near river sections, foothills, or natural lakes, which provided essential resources for early human communities engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plant foods.¹⁰ Given Badamba's strategic location in the middle of the Mahanadi River and surrounding mountain ranges ¹, it is highly probable that the area also supported early human settlements.

**The Bhattarika Temple: Ancient Origins, Mythological Significance, and Buddhist Connections**

A cornerstone of Badamba's ancient heritage is the Bhattarika Temple, located in Sasanga village on the banks of the Mahanadi River, at the foot of Ratnagiri hill.¹, blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com Believed to have been constructed between the 6th and 16th centuries CE, this temple is dedicated to Maa Bhattarika, a manifestation of Shakti, and is considered one of Odisha's 12 Shakti Pithas.¹, (Bhattarika Temple) She is also the revered presiding deity of the Badamba royal family.¹ Historical sources suggest this construction period, though some claims of earlier origins (6th century BCE) appear inconsistent and likely erroneous. (Bhattarika Temple)

The temple is steeped in rich mythological narratives. According to Puranic and local tradition, the sage Parashuram, facing defeat in battle against Saharasjuna (Sahasrajuna), prayed to Durga (Maa Bhattarika) at this very spot to gain divine power. The goddess appeared and empowered him, and he is credited with establishing the pitha (also known as Parsuram Pitha) and carving her image on his arrow tip.², blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com Another legend connects the temple to the epic Ramayana, stating that Ram, Lakshmana, and Sita offered prayers to Goddess Bhattarika on their journey to Panchvati, with their revered footmarks believed to be worshipped on Mankadagadia hill across the Mahanadi.² Puranic accounts even credit other avatars of Vishnu with visiting this temple. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com A third local legend recounts that Krishna, Satyabhama, and Arjun prayed to the goddess after Arjun bravely rescued Satyabhama from the demon Gosimha during his period of disguise.² These legends collectively establish the temple's profound ancient origins and its integral role in the cultural and spiritual fabric of Badamba.

In terms of religious practices, Devi Bhattarika is typically depicted seated in Lalitasana, holding a lotus in one hand and displaying the Varadamudra with the other. A nearby image, Para Bhattarika, is shown with four hands, holding Pasha, Ankusha, Bow, and Arrow.¹² The deity is described as "suryopasanatatpara," indicating a connection to sun worship, further evidenced by an image of the sun god housed in the temple's Jagamohan (assembly hall).¹² The temple’s rituals begin at 3 AM daily, with offerings of fish, khechudi, and pitha. The worship practices are notable for involving non-Brahmin devotees, and the offering of cooked fish as prasadam (sacred food) points to indigenous or folk religious traditions. Moreover, Maa Bhattarika is deeply revered by the local fishermen community as the deity of navigation.² On Maha Ashtami during Dussehra, the priest (Agrapujaka) performs secret rituals with a sword, drawing large crowds. (Odisha Heritage)

The Bhattarika Temple also exhibits a compelling historical link with Buddhism. Some research scholars propose a strong connection, particularly with Tantric or Mahayana Buddhism, during the Bhaumakara rule (8th-10th centuries).² It is suggested that the Somavamsis, who were known adversaries of Buddhism, may have later converted the pitha into a Hindu site. The presence of a small Buddhist image and a later Tara image within the temple further supports this theory.¹² This transition reflects broader regional patterns of religious shifts and the strategic integration of local cults by ruling dynasties.

Major festivals celebrated at the Bhattarika Temple draw pilgrims from across Odisha and include Pana Sankranti (Chaitra Navaratri) in mid-April, which marks the Odia New Year; Akshaya Tritiya in May; and Dussehra in October, which features elaborate Durga Puja rituals, with buffalo sacrifices historically practiced.¹, en.wikipedia.org, (Odisha Heritage)

**Table: Key Legends Associated with Bhattarika Temple**
| Legend/Source | Summary of Legend | Significance to Bhattarika Temple/Badamba |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Parashuram | Prayed to Durga (Bhattarika) for power against Saharasjuna; established the pitha and carved the image. | Establishes ancient, epic-age origins and the deity's power. ², blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com |
| Ramayana | Ram, Lakshmana, and Sita prayed to the goddess; their footmarks are worshipped on Mankadagadia hill. | Links the temple to major Hindu epic, enhancing its sacredness. ² |
| Krishna & Satyabhama | Krishna, Satyabhama, and Arjun prayed to the goddess after Arjun killed the demon Gosimha. | Connects the deity to the Badamba royal family as their presiding deity. ² |
| Origin of Badamba Name | King Hattakishore named his state "Bhuhadamba" after Goddess Bruhatamba (Bhattarika). | Explains the town's name, emphasizing the deity's foundational role. ¹² |

**The Genesis of the Name "Badamba"**

The very name "Badamba," also known as Baramba, is intimately linked to the revered Goddess Bhattarika. It is believed to have originated from her alternative names, such as Bruhatamba, Biradamba, or Votaika, which translate to "The Great Mother".², ¹⁷, blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com According to local legend, King Hattakishore (or his brother Malakeshwar Rawat) honored the goddess by naming his newly established state "Bhuhadamba" or "Baramba," a name that later evolved into the familiar "Badamba".¹², ¹⁷ This cultural naming practice directly connects the town's identity to its spiritual foundations and serves as a testament to the profound influence of local religious beliefs on the town's historical identity.

#### **III. The Princely State of Baramba (1305-1948 CE)**

**Establishment of the Baramba Dynasty by Hatakeshwar Raut**

The Princely State of Baramba was formally established in 1305 CE during the late Eastern Ganga (Gajapati) era.⁴ Its founder was Hatakeshwar Raut, a skilled Chandra Banshi Kshatriya wrestler from Singhbhum. He received a land grant from the then Eastern Ganga emperor Narasimha Deva II, who also recruited military personnel like Raut to defend Odisha against Islamic invaders.², en.wikipedia.org This grant, comprising two villages, Sonkha (Sankha) and Mohuri (Mahuri), was a recognition of Raut's valor.², en.wikipedia.org Upon receiving the grant, Hatakeshwar, alongside his companion Mallakeswar, proceeded to defeat the local Kondhs (Kandha), an aboriginal tribe inhabiting these villages, and subsequently established his capital at Baramba, along the Mahanadi River, approximately three miles south of the present-day palace. (Baramba State) This founding narrative exemplifies a common pattern of state formation in "garhjat" states, where imperial grants and military prowess led to the establishment of new elites over existing tribal lands, who then integrated local elements to legitimize their rule.

**Territorial Expansion and Key Rulers**

Over several centuries, Baramba State steadily expanded its dominion. His younger brother, Malakeshwar Rawat, who succeeded him as the 2nd Raja (1327-1345 CE), further expanded the state's territory to Agalpur (Ogalpur). Jambeswar Raut conquered Kharodh, increasing the state’s area to 36 square miles. Bholeswar Raut further expanded to Ratapat, and Kanhu Raut to Mahulia. Under Nabin Rawat (1537–1560), Baramba reached its largest extent, spanning 18 miles east to west and 8.5 miles north to south. By the era of the British Raj, the state had grown to cover 142 square miles (368 km²) and included 181 villages.², blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com The population of Baramba also saw significant growth, from 29,772 in 1892 to 46,689 by 1939.⁴ It is important to note that "Baramba" State should be distinguished from "Bamra" (also known as Bamanda) State, another princely state in Odisha.

The rulers of Baramba State initially held the title of Rawat, later transitioning to Raja. The dynastic continuity is remarkable, spanning over six centuries. The following tables provide chronological overviews of the rulers, based on different historical records:

**Administrative Structure, Autonomy, and External Relations**

Throughout the medieval period, Baramba was a minor feudatory in Odisha, acknowledging the suzerainty of larger dynasties like the Gajapatis of Puri but retaining local autonomy. In the 18th century, Odisha fell under Maratha rule. The Maratha governors recognized Baramba as one of the twenty-four semi-autonomous Garjat states, and the Raja paid tribute (peskas) but managed his own affairs. ddceutkal.ac.in Under Maratha and later Mughal oversight, Baramba remained a significant local principality, with a focus on cultural and religious development. (Bengal Gazetteers, 1910), ddceutkal.ac.in

After the Marathas were defeated in 1803, the British annexed Odisha, and Baramba became a princely state under British suzerainty, part of the Orissa (Eastern States) Agency.¹, en.wikipedia.org While acknowledging British paramountcy and paying an annual tribute of 1,398 rupees, the state maintained nominal internal autonomy.¹⁶, ¹⁹ The state maintained its own military force (708 infantry and three guns in 1893) and its family emblem was a dog metamorphosed into a lion, stemming from a legend of a dog killing a tiger, symbolizing resilience.¹⁷, (History of Badamba Town, Odisha, India)

Baramba faced conflicts with neighboring states, including an invasion and 13-month occupation by Khandpara during Padmanava Birbar Mangaraj's reign (1748–1793) and conflicts with Narsinghpur (circa 1175, with forts regained via Maratha assistance). (History of Badamba Town, Odisha, India) An alliance with the Prince of Badamba helped the Badamba princess Sukadei, Queen of Banki, defeat the King of Khurda. These incidents illustrate the dynamic nature of regional politics.³⁰

Before its merger with India, Baramba was noted for its "excellent administration." It had organized courts, schools, a functional jail system (including a Sub-Jail established in 1926), and advanced health services, notably an Ayurvedic Hospital.², (Baramba Sub-Jail) The last ruler, Maharaja Narayan Chandra Birabara Mangaraj Mohapatra, built a grand new palace (the Rajabati) on a 3-acre foothill site in the 1920s, with an adjoining Jagannath temple complex. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com

**Socio-Economic Landscape and Cultural Practices in the Princely Period**

The socio-economic foundation was primarily agrarian, with rice, pulses, and oil seeds as major crops.²⁵ The state also traded forest products like timber and lac overseas. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com The region was renowned for traditional handicrafts. Dhokra casting was practiced in the Baramba-Narasinghpur area.²⁵ More significantly, Ikat weaving flourished in Maniabandha village. The Maniabandh tie-dye (bandha) saree, made with cotton and silk, achieved historical recognition in the 12th century when a tie-dyed Ikat with verses from the Gita Govinda was offered to Lord Jagannath of Puri.² This led to the tradition of the Puri temple sourcing Khanduas from Maniabandha weavers.²⁷ The ruler of Baramba patronized these weavers, helping make the saree famous beyond Odisha. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com A unique aspect of these weavers is their identity as Buddhists who are also strong adherents of the Jagannath cult.²

The cult of Jagannath played a pivotal role in legitimizing the rulers of Baramba, whose participation in Jagannath ceremonies elevated their status within the regional hierarchy.¹⁹ Local legends of tribal sacrifices to protect dynastic honor were also integrated into the royal pantheon.¹⁹

#### **IV. The Path to Integration: Prajamandal Movement and Post-Independence Merger (1930s-1948)**

**Baramba's Role in the Prajamandal Movement**

The Prajamandal movement, a popular struggle within the princely states from the 1920s, campaigned against autocratic rule and demanded rights like the abolition of forced labor and illegal taxes.³¹ Baramba was explicitly identified as one of the Garhjat states where the populace "raised their voice under the aegis of their Prajamandal units," indicating active participation.³¹ This popular pressure, fueled by the formation of the Odisha province in 1936, was instrumental in creating the conditions for integration.³¹

**Accession to the Indian Union and Integration into Cuttack District**

On January 1, 1948, the last ruler of Baramba, Narayan Chandra Birbar Mangaraj Mahapatra, formally signed the Instrument of Accession, joining the Indian Union.⁴, en.wikipedia.org This marked the end of Baramba's centuries-long status as a princely state. Immediately following its accession, Baramba State was merged into the Cuttack district of Odisha.⁴, en.wikipedia.org This was part of a larger process encouraged by Sardar Patel, where 25 Garhjat states were integrated into the province, recognizing the growing threat posed by the Prajamandal movements.³⁴

#### **V. Badamba in Modern Odisha (1947-Present)**

**Evolution of Local Governance and Administrative Changes**

Following integration, Badamba underwent significant administrative restructuring. The Badamba Block began functioning in 1952 and became a Community Development (CD) Block in 1964, shifting towards a welfare-oriented model focused on economic development and social justice.³⁵ As a rural block headquarters within Cuttack district, Badamba block today has about 150,000 inhabitants across 138 villages in 38 gram panchayats. en.wikipedia.org On February 24, 2024, the Government of Odisha upgraded Badamba from a gram panchayat to a Notified Area Council (NAC), formalizing its urban status.¹, en.wikipedia.org The principal village of Badamba (Nizigarh) had a population of 1,797 in the 1901 census and 6,284 in 2011.³⁹

**Major Development Initiatives and Infrastructure Projects**

Post-independence Badamba has been the focus of various state-sponsored development initiatives. A significant undertaking is the Hadua Irrigation Project, which aims to construct a dam and canal system to irrigate drought-prone areas in both Baramba and Narasinghpur blocks, including a rehabilitation village for displaced families.³⁷ The Panchayat Samiti Office in Baramba also implements various block-level development programs, creating permanent assets for infrastructure development, though challenges like "consumerism-generated poverty" have emerged.³⁵, ³⁸ Ongoing efforts like the "Effective Local Governance for Development Project" aim to strengthen local administration.³⁶

**Table: Key Post-Independence Development Projects and Initiatives**
| Project/Initiative | Description | Status/Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hadua Irrigation Project | Construction of dam, spillway, head regulator, and canal system on Hadua river to irrigate drought-prone areas of Baramba and Narasinghpur blocks. | Pre-construction surveys in progress; includes rehabilitation village for displaced families. ³⁷ |
| Panchayat Samiti Development Programs | Implementation of various schemes for economic development and social justice, including infrastructure creation, pension distribution, housing, and self-employment loans. | Ongoing since 1952 (CD Block 1964); aims for all-round rural development. ³⁵ |
| Badamba NAC Upgrade | Formal administrative upgrade of Badamba village to a Notified Area Council. | Effective February 24, 2024; signifies urbanization and enhanced local governance. ¹ |
| Effective Local Governance for Development Project | Initiative involving community organizers to strengthen local administration and service delivery. | Ongoing; aims to improve governance and development outcomes. ³⁶ |

**Contemporary Socio-Economic Transformations and Urbanization Trends**

Badamba's upgrade to an NAC formalizes its urban status. This reflects broader trends, including the "feminization of migration," where women from rural areas move to cities for employment, seeking independence.⁴⁰ Traditional occupations persist but are adapting. Agriculture, fishing, and paddy cultivation remain the mainstay of the local economy. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com Ikat weaving in Maniabandha continues, but weavers face challenges like dependency on middlemen, necessitating interventions from organizations like Antaran.²⁷ Other cottage industries like bateen handicrafts and lac jewelry complement the economy. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com The Janughanta tradition, a form of alms-seeking with storytelling, has also adapted, with adherents combining it with other professions.⁴¹ Modern Badamba also hosts a modest tourist trade, as visitors come for temple fairs, the scenic Ansupa lake, and regional handicrafts. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com

**The Enduring Legacy of Local Handicrafts, Traditions, and Personalities**

Badamba's cultural identity is preserved through its handicrafts and traditions. Ikat weaving in Maniabandha and Dhokra casting in the Baramba-Narasinghpur region remain significant.², ²⁵ Folk traditions like dance and theater also thrive; for example, the plays of Kalicharan Pattnaik often drew on Badamba legends. blogvirasatehind.wordpress.com The Janughanta tradition also continues, showcasing cultural resilience.⁴¹

**Notable Personalities**
Badamba has produced notable cultural figures. **Kalicharan Pattnaik (Kabichandra)** (1898–1978) was born in the then-Princely State of Badamba. He became a pioneering Odissi musician, playwright, and lyricist whose dance-dramas like *Rasalila* helped popularize Odissi arts. Honored with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977, he is remembered as one of Odisha’s cultural stalwarts. en.wikipedia.org

#### **VII. Conclusion**

Badamba presents a compelling historical narrative, from its ancient roots in the Mahanadi basin and the syncretic Bhattarika Temple to its centuries-long existence as the Princely State of Baramba. Established in 1305 CE, the Baramba dynasty navigated complex relationships with regional powers like the Gangas, Gajapatis, and later the Marathas, maintaining rule for over six centuries under a system of feudal allegiance, military cooperation, and cultural integration. Under British paramountcy, it operated under a unique system of indirect rule, allowing for internal development.

The transition to modern India, marked by active participation in the Prajamandal movement and formal accession in 1948, ushered in a new era of democratic governance and state-led development. Today, Badamba continues to evolve, characterized by modernization, urbanization, and the adaptation of traditional livelihoods like Ikat weaving. It stands as a microcosm of Odisha's historical trajectory, embodying the interplay of indigenous traditions, dynastic rule, colonial influence, and post-independence development. Its unique cultural landscape, defined by ancient temples, vibrant handicrafts, and a rich legacy embodied by figures like Kalicharan Pattnaik, ensures its enduring significance as a historical and cultural hub in Odisha.
