# Maa Bhattarika Temple, Badamba, Odisha

## Introduction

The Maa Bhattarika Temple, also known as Bhattarike Temple, is a revered Hindu shrine located in Sasanga village, Badamba tehsil, Cuttack district, Odisha, India. Nestled on the banks of the Mahanadi River, this temple is dedicated to Maa Bhattarika, a powerful manifestation of Shakti. It is one of the 12 Shakti Peethas in Odisha, holding immense religious and cultural significance. The temple’s picturesque setting, surrounded by the Ratnagiri mountains, makes it a popular destination for both pilgrims and tourists seeking spiritual solace and natural beauty.

## History and Legend

The Bhattarika Temple is steeped in ancient mythology, with its origins linked to the Tretaya Yuga. According to legend, Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, visited the Ratnagiri hills near the temple. His axe fell from his hand, signaling a divine presence. Through meditation, he recognized this presence as Goddess Bhattarika and sought her blessings, earning the site the name Parsuram Pitha. Another Puranic tradition suggests that Parashurama prayed to Goddess Durga at this spot to gain divine power to defeat his enemy, Saharsrajuna. Some sources indicate the temple may have been established between the 6th and 16th centuries BCE, with Parashurama carving the goddess’s image at the tip of his arrow.
